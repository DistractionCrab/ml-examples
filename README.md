# MachineLearningExamples
 
This is a repository of ML examples I have been compiling as a resource for others and some demos. I'm currently in the process of moving over generalizations of older projects to this repository. Current tasks include:

- Implementations of modern A2C/A3C
- Attention Networks
- Attention based feature extraction
- NLP examples
